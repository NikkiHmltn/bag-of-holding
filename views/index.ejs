            <p>Bag of Holding is a place for you to store your character concepts for D&D 5e. Select your characters class, race, and background, as well as give them descriptors like their biography or looks! All character are stored in your Profile so they're always one click away. </p>

            <p>This application is currently in alpha, and was developed as a project for General Assembly's software engineering bootcamp. I will be adding updates and features as I find the time to between class, or after. Thank you so much for checking this out! Maybe your campaigns be fun, and your character never die!</p>
